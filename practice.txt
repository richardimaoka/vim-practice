When the VMs are healthy, test the load balancer using a web browser, going to http://IP_ADDRESS/, replacing IP_ADDRESS with the load balancer's IP address.

This may take three to five minutes. If you do not connect, wait a minute, and then reload the browser.

Your browser should render a page with content showing the name of the instance that served the page, along with its zone (for example, Page served from: lb-backend-group-xxxx).

Go faster.

e.g. we're going too slow

Find the first occurrence of {char} and move to it.
